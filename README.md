HOW TO ADD AN ARTICLE?

(FuzzyBTC, correct this. I'm explaining my PHP code here)

Create file articles/x, where x is number of your article. Use tags <articleheader> and <text>. Don't forget an anchor to full article: <a href="fullarticle.php?id=x">Full article</a> and substitute x by your number.
Then, create file fullarticle/x . Tags here too.
